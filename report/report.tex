\section{Overview}
\begin{framed}
  Discuss the high level goals of your work, along with any
  interesting/key findings.
\end{framed}

Our objective was to understand and experience the issues that arise
when actually implementing program analyses. To this end, we
constructed a dataflow analysis framework based on the LLVM compiler
infastructure.

We confirmed through experience that SSA makes flow functions
\emph{much} easier to write. We found that the most helpful part of
the LLVM API is the object hierarchy for dealing with the graph of
Value objects representing LLVM IR. Subclasses of Value are rich,
representing functions, basic blocks, instructions, constants,
etc. These IR object classes provide many useful convienence functions
and make it easy to traverse the program. The least helpful parts of
the LLVM API is the pass manager and the special LLVM replacement for
C++ run-time type information; these features are obscure and
difficult to use.

The most surprising feature of LLVM was the InstVisitor template
class. This class made our implementation much easier and cleaner than
it would have been otherwise, but examples in the introductory
documentation do not use it. For something so helpful to LLVM
newcomers, InstVisitor is poorly advertised in the LLVM documentation.

Though the analyses were relatively straightforward in terms of flow
functions, the technical hurdles of actually making them work were
nontrivial, and we learned a great deal. This project provided a solid
foundation of practical experience for building programming-language
tools based on LLVM. We document our implementation efforts in the
following pages, beginning with the overall design for the dataflow
analysis framework. 

% We found numerous conceptual mismatches between the LLVM IR and other
% programming languages (including assemblers). Registers may only be
% assigned to at one site of the program (SSA), and variables in a
% high-level language may be represented by either a sequence of these
% registers or as a memory location. The expressions of a high-level
% language can become chains of instructions in the IR, changing the
% definition of CSE. The reasons for these design choices became clear
% as we worked our way through implementation of the analyses, and will
% be expanded on in the appropriate sections.


\section{Interface Design}
\begin{framed}
  Describe interface. Discuss what alternative designs you may have
  also considered, and explain the tradeoffs that ultimately led to
  your choice.
\end{framed}


\begin{description}
\item[LatticePoint] Every dataflow analysis requires a Lattice to work
  over. The \emph{LatticePoint} class describes our interface to these
  points. Anything that inherits from \emph{LatticePoint} must
  implement:
  \begin{description}
  \item[equals$(LP) \rightarrow $Bool] Compare this latticepoint and
    the argument for equality, returning a Boolean.
  \item[join$(LP) \rightarrow LP$] Return a new LatticePoint
    containing the join of this LatticePoint and the argument.
  \item[isBottom$() \rightarrow $Bool] Returns true if this
    latticePoint is Bottom
  \item[isTop$() \rightarrow $Bool] Returns true if this latticePoint
    is Top.
  \end{description}
\item[FlowFunction] This class provides an interface to calling flow
  functions. Derived classes must implement a single special function:
  \[
  \textbf{operator}(Instruction, Vector \langle LP\rangle) \rightarrow
  Vector \langle LP \rangle
  \]
  Implementing the ``operator'' function makes objects of this type
  callable. To define each analysis we make a subclass of
  \emph{FlowFunction} that can operate on a particular type of
  \emph{LatticePoint}. When ``operator'' is called, a single step of
  the flow function is exectued with the argument \emph{LatticePoints}
  as incoming edges on the control flow graph. A vector of
  \emph{LatticePoints} that should be on the outgoing edges of this
  instruction is returned.
\item[Analysis] This class contains the implementation of the worklist
  algorithm. It is not an interface, and is not meant to be derived
  from. It has one public function:
  \[
  \textbf{analyze}(Function, FlowFunction, LP) \rightarrow
  Map \langle Instruction, LP \rangle
  \]
\end{description}




To use our framework, a caller  first instanciates a ``bottom''
\emph{LatticePoint} and a \emph{FlowFunction} of matching types. Then,
in an LLVM Pass, the caller supplies a function and the aforementioned
objects to \textbf{analyze}. 

Adding an additional analysis to the framework amounts to providing
new derived classes of \emph{LatticePoint} and \emph{FlowFunction}.

% issue with this design: positional encoding of true/false branches
% (or whatever) in the return type of operator()

Unsure how honest to be here. Tradeoffs ended up being, how many C++
features can we avoid and still have a functioning C++ program? Other
than this issue, describing our interface (flowfunction object,
latticepoint object, and a blob of code implementing the worklist
algorithm that uses runtime polymorphism to use these objects) is
pretty straightforward. I (marco) can write this.

\section{Conclusion/Challenges}
\begin{framed}
  As this project is significantly more exploratory than the first, we
  want you to tell us what you found particularly
  interesting/challenging/frustrating. What extensions to the project
  did you attempt? (for instance, did you try combining the results of
  analyses, or did you try your hand at interprocedural
  analysis?). What aspects of LLVM made it easy/hard to implement your
  design? If you could redo your project with what you know now, what
  changes would you make?
\end{framed}

Since this project primarily dealt with framework design within preexisting, customized system, the majority of our challenges pertained to making our design work within the environment that LLVM provided to us. For example, getting the LatticePoint object-oriented hierarchy to work within LLVM's custom dyn\_cast implementation forced us to alter our design several times.

On the other hand, we did manage to take advantage of native LLVM constructs, such as extending the InstVisitor class. Since InstVisitor already has the capability to ``decorate" each type of instruction with different ``visit" methods, we were able to implement a flow function by overriding the ``visit" method corresponding to the correct instruction.
